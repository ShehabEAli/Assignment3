 1 - > What is the Node.js Event Loop?
The Event Loop is a mechanism inside Node.js that allows it to handle non-blocking operations.
It continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue.
If the call stack is empty, it takes the next callback from the queue and executes it.
This makes Node.js able to run asynchronous code efficiently.


 2 - > What is Libuv and What Role Does It Play in Node.js?
Libuv is a C library used by Node.js to handle asynchronous operations.
It provides:

The Event Loop

Thread Pool

Asynchronous I/O (file system, DNS, etc.)

Timers
It is the core layer that makes Node.js non-blocking.



 3 - > How Does Node.js Handle Asynchronous Operations Under the Hood?
When you call an async function (like reading a file):

Node sends the task to Libuv

Libuv either uses the thread pool or OS APIs

Once done, Libuv pushes the callback to the Event Queue

The Event Loop takes the callback and executes it when the call stack is empty
This is how Node.js avoids blocking the main thread.



 4 - > Difference Between Call Stack, Event Queue, and Event Loop
Call Stack:
Where the currently running JavaScript code is executed.
Functions are pushed and popped from here.

Event Queue (Callback Queue):
Where callbacks of finished async operations wait to be executed.

Event Loop:
A controller that constantly checks:
“If the call stack is empty, move the next callback from the queue to the stack.”



 5 - > What is the Node.js Thread Pool and How to Set Its Size?
The Thread Pool is a set of background threads provided by Libuv (default = 4 threads).
Used for heavy operations like:

File System

DNS lookups

Compression

Crypto

To change its size  ::: SET UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=8



6 - > How Does Node.js Handle Blocking and Non-Blocking Code Execution?
Blocking code:
Runs on the main thread and stops everything until it finishes.
Example: fs.readFileSync()

Non-Blocking code:
Delegates work to Libuv thread pool or OS, so the main thread stays free.
Example: fs.readFile()

Node.js always prefers non-blocking operations to stay fast and responsive.
